**Introduction:**



Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small and medium-sized businesses to
customers across Brazil. The platform operates as a marketplace, where merchants can list
their products and services and customers can browse and purchase them online.
The Olist sales dataset available on Kaggle is a collection of anonymized data about orders
placed on the Olist platform between January 2017 and August 2018. It contains a wide range
of information about each order, including the order date, product details, payment and shipping
information, customer and seller IDs, and customer reviews. The dataset also includes
information about the sellers who list their products on Olist, as well as data on customer
behavior and demographics. The dataset is designed to help analysts and researchers better
understand the e-commerce landscape in Brazil and identify opportunities for growth and
optimization.
